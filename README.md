### Security Researcher • Bug Hunter • Open-Source Tester

I am **John Sebastain Larvin**.  
I find bugs where systems assume nothing can go wrong.

## 🧠 About Me

I am a bug hunter and security researcher focused on **real, reproducible issues**.

I don’t chase noise.  
I don’t submit weak reports.  
I work on bugs that **actually affect systems**.

- 🐞 Reported and rewarded for multiple valid bugs  
- 🛡️ Practice responsible disclosure  
- 🧪 Linux kernel testing and edge-case validation  
- 🧑‍⚖️ GitHub moderation and platform testing  
- 🌍 Based in the **USA**

This account is new.  
The work is not.

## ⚔️ What I Work On

- Authentication & authorization issues  
- Logic flaws and edge cases  
- Date, time, and future-state bugs  
- Platform permission issues  
- Open-source and infrastructure testing  

If a system behaves differently tomorrow,  
I test it **today**.

## 🧩 Mindset

> Tools don’t find bugs.  
> Thinking does.

I believe in:
- Clear proof over long explanations  
- Impact over volume  
- Quality over count  

Every report should answer one question:
**“Does this actually matter?”**

I test what happens when those limits are crossed.”
