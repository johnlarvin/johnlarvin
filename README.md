## Profile

I am **John Sebastain Larvin**, a cybersecurity professional focused on vulnerability research, system testing, and responsible disclosure.

My work centers on identifying practical security issues in real systems, with emphasis on correctness, reproducibility, and impact. I contribute to platform security, open-source testing, and moderation efforts within the developer ecosystem.

## Areas of Work

- Security vulnerability research and bug hunting  
- Responsible disclosure and security reporting  
- Linux kernel testing and edge-case validation  
- Platform moderation and policy enforcement  
- Automation using shell scripts and custom scripts  
- Security testing through automated and manual methods  

---

## Technical Focus

- Authorization and permission flaws  
- Logic errors and edge-case behavior  
- Date, time, and future-state system issues  
- Platform and infrastructure security  
- Open-source code review and testing  

Automation is used where appropriate, but all findings are validated manually.

## Tooling and Automation

- Shell scripting for testing and automation  
- Custom scripts for security validation  
- Reproducible test cases and minimal proofs  
- Controlled environments for system testing  

Automation supports analysis; it does not replace it.

## Approach

Security work should be:
- Accurate  
- Verifiable  
- Responsible  

Every report should clearly answer:
What is the issue?  
Why does it matter?  
How can it be reproduced?
